Put all your training images WITHOUT vests in this folder.

Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png

Example filenames:
- person_no_vest_001.jpg
- no_vest_image_1.png
- training_no_vest.jpg

IMPORTANT: See ../LABELING_GUIDE.md for what counts as "no_vest"
- Regular clothing only (no safety vest visible)
- Orange/yellow shirts are NOT vests (unless they have reflective strips)
- When in doubt, put here (better to miss a vest than create false positives)

Make sure images clearly show people NOT wearing vests.
